    <h1>Macarons</h1>
    <img src="../resources/macarons.jpg">
    <h2>Delicate sandwich cookies that can be flavored and decorated to your liking.</h3> 
    <p>These French treats have a light, crisp shell that gives way to chewy texture within. You can eat them plain or add fillings such as caramel, buttercream, Nutella, and more!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g Egg whites (about 3-4 large egg whites)</li>
        <li>1g Cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Vanilla extract (or other flavoring)</li>
        <li>80g Superfine sugar</li>
        <li>125g Almond flour</li>
        <li>125g Confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>Macaron filling of your choice</li>
        <li>optional: 1-2 drops Gel food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>One day before making macarons, wipe down a large bowl with lemon juice or vinegar and add the egg whites. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Then bring the egg whites to room temperature before starting.</li>
        <li>Add the cream of tartar and flavoring to the egg whites. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or using a hand mixer, beat the eggs on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add 1/3 of the superfine sugar and beat on medium-high speed for 5 seconds. While continuing to beat, add another 1/3 of the superfine sugar and beat for 5 seconds, then add the remaining superfine sugar and beat until stiff glossy peaks form. Optional: beat in food coloring just before or after stiff peaks have formed.</li>
        <li>Sift the almond flour and confectioner's sugar together.</li>
        <li>Gently and slowly fold the almond flour mixture into the beaten egg whites in 3 separate additions using a rubber spatula. Fold until combined before adding the next addition. After all additions have been folded in, continue folding the batter until it thins to the consistency of honey.</li>
        <li>Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into a piping bag fitted with a medium round piping tip.</li>
        <li>Hold the piping bag at a 90 degree angle over the baking sheet and pipe the batter in 1.5-2 inch rounds about 1-2 inches apart. Tap the pan on the counter several times to release any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Let the macarons sit to dry out until their tops firm up and form a skin, about 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
        <li>Bake 13 minutes or until the macarons don't seem wobbly after being gently touched.</li>
        <li>Cool the shells on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, fill and sandwich shells together with a filling of your choice.</li>
        <li>Macarons can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
