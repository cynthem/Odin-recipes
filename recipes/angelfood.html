        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C) and adjust the oven rack to the lower middle position.</li>
            <li>Pulse the sugar until find and powdery in a food processor or blender. Remove and set aside 1 cup to use in step 3. Add the cake flour and salt to the food processor with the remaining sugar and pulse 5-10 times until the mixture is light and aerated.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, whip egg whites and cream of tartar togther on medium-low until foamy, about 1 minute. On medium-high, slowly add the 1 cup of sugar that was set aside and then continuing whipping until soft peaks form, about 5-6 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat until just incorporated.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour mixture into the egg white mixture in 3 additions using a fine mesh strainer. Gently fold the mixtures together with a spatula after each addition. Then pour the batter into an ungreased 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Gently shake the pan on the counter to smooth out the surface of the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Rotate the pan halfway through baking.</li>
            <li>After removing from the oven, cool the cake upside-down on a wire rack, about 3 hours. Once it is completely cooled, run a thin knife around the edges and tap on the upside-down pan until the cake releases. Use a serrated knife to cut the cake to prevent compression.</li>
            <li>Optional: dust with confectioner's sugar and serve with whipped cream and fresh berries.</li>
            <li>Leftovers can be stored for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
